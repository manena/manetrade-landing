    <!-- Introduction to Put Credit Spreads -->
    <section id="about-puts" class="section">
        <h2>Understanding Credit Put Spreads</h2>
        <p>Credit Put Spreads involve selling a put option while simultaneously buying a lower strike put, creating a spread. This approach allows you to limit potential losses while collecting a credit. The strategy benefits when the underlying stock remains above the sold strike price, and it has a lower risk of assignment compared to credit call spreads.</p>
        <p>While assignment risk remains, especially if the position is in-the-money near expiration, managing strong underlying assets helps minimize this risk.</p>
